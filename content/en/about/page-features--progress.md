The Progress page can be reached by going to the Bible Books page and clicking the "Progress" button at the top.

The Progress page gives you a high-level overview of your reading progress.

## Reading Settings

You can see your reading settings, including your "look back date" and "daily verse count goal".
You can also see how many verses you've read so far and the percentage of the Bible you've read.

## Reading Predictions

This page will use your reading habits to predict when you will finish reading the Bible.
It first determines how many verses you've read each day on average, then it uses that reading speed
to calculate how much longer it will take you to read the remaining verses.

You can see four separate predictions, each based on your reading progress over a particular period of time:

**Your Historical Outlook:**
This estimate uses your progress since your look back date (the date you started using My Bible Log, or the date you specifically chose later on).

**Your 30-Day Outlook:**
This estimate uses your progress over the past 30 days, or roughly the past month.
Because it takes over four weeks of reading history into account, this estimate can be more accurate than the daily or weekly outlook.

Also, if you took a break from reading at some point, that break could negatively impact your Historical Outlook.
However, if you keep up your reading habit for 30 days, this will still give you a solid estimate of when you will finish reading.

**Your 7-Day Outlook:**
This estimate uses your progress over the past 7 days, or the past week.
Different days of the week make it easier or harder to read the Bible.
This outlook can be more accurate than Today's Outlook, as it helps give you a balanced view
of how long it will take to finish reading the Bible, even if some days make it harder to read than others.

**Today's Outlook:**
This estimate uses your progress for today.
If you are just starting or re-starting your Bible reading habit, this estimate makes it easy
to determine how long it will take to finish the Bible if you keep up today's pace.

## Set a Goal

The Progress page also allows you to set a goal date for when you want to finish reading the Bible.

My Bible Log will work backwards from that goal date to determine how many verses you need to read each day
to finish reading the Bible by your goal date.

This is a great way to determine how much reading you need to do to finish reading the Bible by the end of the year,
or by any other goal date you choose.
