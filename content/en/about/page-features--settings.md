# Settings Page

The Settings page is organized into several panels:

* Account
* Reading
* Daily Reminder Emails
* Export
* Import

## Account

When the Settings page is first opened the Account panel will be displayed.

From here you can:

* change your email address
* delete your account

## Reading

The Reading panel allows you to adjust settings related to reading the Bible. These include your **Daily Verse Count Goal** and **Look Back Date**.

### Daily Verse Count Goal

Your daily verse count goal is the number of Bible verses you want to read each day. This setting affects the way progress bars behave on the Today page and Calendar page.

To help you decide what your daily verse count goal should be, this section shows you how many days it will take to read the Bible if you reach your verse count goal each day. By default, this value is 86, which will allow you to read the entire Bible in less than 365 days.

### Look Back Date

Your look back date determines how far back in your reading log My Bible Log will look when determining your progress. Your look back date starts out as the date when you first started using My Bible Log.

Log entries before this date are ignored. As an example, the Bible Books page will not display reading you've done before your look back date.

If you read the entire Bible and want to start over and read every part of the Bible again, setting your look back date to the current date will clear your progress on the Bible Books page and allow your log entries to be considered "new" verses again on the Today page and Calendar page.

Changing your look back date will not delete any data from My Bible Log. All of your log entries still exist and can be viewed at any time from the Calendar page.

### Preferred Bible Version

You can choose a translation that you prefer to use for reading. External reading links will open this Bible translation in your preferred reading app.

If a translation you want to use isn't listed, please request it with [this form](/feedback).

### Preferred Bible App

You can choose the app or website that will be opened when you click a reading link.

This setting is stored on the device rather than on your account, allowing you to use different apps or websites on different devices.

If a website or app you want to use isn't listed, please request it with [this form](/feedback).

## Daily Reminder Emails

You can opt in to receiving a daily email reminder from My Bible Log. The email will arrive at a time of your choosing.

### Opt-in

You must confirm that you wish to receive a daily reminder email. My Bible Log does not send unsolicited emails.

You can disable reminder emails from your settings at any time. Each email also contains an instant unsubscribe link.

### Reminder Time

You must choose a time to receive your daily reminder email. This allows the reminders to be a helpful and intentional part of your daily routine.

## Export

### Reading Log (CSV)

Your reading log can be exported as a spreadsheet (in the CSV file format). This allows you to work with your data in any way you see fit.

If you have some coding skills or know someone who does, you could use this data to create new charts and graphs. You could even combine My Bible Log export data from multiple people.

Below is an example of what a My Bible Log export spreadsheet looks like. The "Date" and "Passage" headings will not appear in the file.

|Date|Passage|
|---|---|
|2020-07-21|Matthew 1-3|
|2020-07-22|Matthew 4-9|
|2020-07-22|Matthew 10-11|
|2020-07-23|Matthew 12-13|
|2020-07-23|Matthew 14-17|
|2020-07-24|Matthew 18-21|
|2020-07-24|Matthew 22-28|

Below is what the CSV file looks like in a text editor. Notice how a comma appears between the date and passage, as this is a Comma Seprated Values (CSV) file.

```csv
2020-07-21,Matthew 1-3
2020-07-22,Matthew 4-9
2020-07-22,Matthew 10-11
2020-07-23,Matthew 12-13
2020-07-23,Matthew 14-17
2020-07-24,Matthew 18-21
2020-07-24,Matthew 22-28
```

### Notes and Tags (Text File)

You can export your notes and tags in a text file.

While the reading log export (CSV file) can be automatically imported back into My Bible Log, the notes export cannot be automatically imported.
However, you can always manually re-create notes and tags from your export file if you need to recover your data.

## Import

You are able to import a reading log spreadsheet (in the CSV file format) to My Bible Log. You can import a spreadsheet you created yourself, or you can import a spreadsheet you previously exported from My Bible Log.

The reading log import feature uses the same file format as the reading log export feature.

When you import a spreadsheet, the import progress will be displayed on the page. My Bible Log will not recreate log entries that already exist. If you read Genesis 1 on January 1 and tracked it in My Bible Log, then imported a spreadsheet that included a log entry for that same passage and date, My Bible Log would ignore it.
