# Bible Books Page

</div>

The Bible Books page helps you track your reading progress through the entire Bible. At the top, you'll see a visual progress bar that shows which parts of the Bible you've read. Unlike a simple left-to-right progress bar, this one fills in exactly where you've read - whether that's at the beginning, middle, or end of the Bible.

Think of it like the edge of a paper Bible: if the pages you've read turned blue, this is what you'd see.

Below the progress bar, you'll find a list of all Bible books. Each book has:

* A gray star that turns gold when you complete the book
* Its own progress bar showing how much of that book you've read

## Individual Book Pages

Click any book to see its detailed progress page. Here you'll find:

* The same Bible-wide progress bar at the top
* A grid of chapters for that book
* Progress bars and completion stars for each chapter
* Verse counts showing how many verses you've read in each chapter

For each chapter, you have two options:

* **Open** - Opens the chapter in your preferred Bible app (YouVersion on mobile, BibleGateway on desktop)
* **Track** - Creates a new reading log entry for that chapter. You can adjust the entry before saving, which is helpful if you:
  * Only read part of the chapter
  * Want to log multiple chapters at once
