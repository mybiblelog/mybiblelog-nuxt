# Account Creation

My Bible Log supports several methods of authentication to make it easy to get started.

## Social Sign In

Users who have a Google account may use it to sign in. The sign in page has a "Sign in with Google" button which will redirect to Google for you to sign in.

Users never enter their Google password in My Bible Log. Once a user has logged into Google, Google will redirect to My Bible Log and pass along verification that you have logged into that website.

## Local Account Creation

User accounts are tied to email addresses. Signing in with Google is one way to verify an email address.

Users who wish to sign in to My Bible Log directly can register on the site. To do so, provide an email address and password. A verification link will be sent to the provided email address, and the email address must be verified with this link before a user can sign in.

By verifying email addresses, My Bible Log prevents spam accounts from abusing server resources and ensures the site remains speedy and performant for all users.

## Changing Login Methods

Users can also switch between methods of authentication. Since an email address is what identifies an account, you can sign into the same account using Google or your local password.

Users who previously used social login and do not have a password are able to create one:

* Go to the login page
* Click "Sign In" (no need to fill in the email or password)
* A link will appear offering to reset your password via email. Click it.
* Open the email and click the link.
* You are now able to create a password on My Bible Log.
* Once your password is created, you will be automatically logged in.

## Change Account Email Address

Users can change their email address from the Settings page.

Under the "Account" section there is a "Change Email" button.
